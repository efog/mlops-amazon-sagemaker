    "ML Monitoring is a critical MLOps capability to reduce risk and manage safe and reliable production machine learning systems at scale. SageMaker contains several integrated services such as [SageMaker Model Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor.html) and [SageMaker Clarify](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/clarify/) to monitor models for data and model quality, bias, and feature attribution drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor continuously monitors the quality of Amazon SageMaker machine learning models in production. With Model Monitor, you can set alerts that notify you when there are deviations in the model quality. Early and proactive detection of these deviations enables you to take corrective actions, such as retraining models, auditing upstream systems, or fixing quality issues without having to monitor models manually or build additional tooling. Model Monitor integrates with SageMaker Clarify to provide pre-built and extendable monitors to get start with monitoring your ML models faster."
